# Portfolio Assignment

## Project Description:
    The assignment was to create a working portfolio page with CSS and HTML. To do this we had to have a proper header with a nav bar that brought you to different sections. The 3 sections I added were “About Me”, “Projects”, and “Contact”. After clicking one of the 3 navbar links, it will bring you to the correct section.

        -The About Me section is just a brief description of myself and my current life. I also added a picture of me and my fiance.

        -The Project section contains my current projects that I have with screenshots of them and a brief description of what they are and why I made them.

        -The Contact section includes my github profile and also a link to my email.

    The purpose of this project was to make a website from scratch and to make sure it was responsive to multiple different viewing sizes.

## How to use:
        When you first load the page you will get my name and a navbar. When you click on one of the navbar links it will bring you to the corresponding section. If you click on the about me you will be brought to a section with a picture and brief description of me.
    If you click on the project section, you will be brought to a box with my projects on it. If you hover over a picture of one of my projects it will change shape. When you click on the image of the project it will bring you to it’s deployed website. It is followed by a brief description of what I learned and why I did each project.
    The contact section contains two links. One to my email and one to my github profile. Each one has a hover effect that helps you know which one you are clicking on.
