            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Hello, I'm Alex Frankhouser. I started coding in 2022 and fell in love. What I
                    love about coding is that there's much to learn and improve upon.
                    Also, it's extremely satasfiying to watch the hardwork put into a project come together and make
                    something amazing! I love putting my all into something and producing unique
                    works of art. When people describe me they tend to use the phrase "black & white person". I enjoy
                    working with teams or by myself. No matter the situation I am faced with I will always stick it through!

                    Previously in life I went to college to become a teacher and become a physical therapist assitant. I
                    completed my Massachusetts Tests for Educator License (MTEL's).
                    After completing my MTEL's, I started my schooling to become a Physcial Therapist Assistant. Once I
                    graduated I realized that working in the healthcare field was not for me so
                    I started my next venture by working full time at a wood yard. During this time I started from the
                    bottom and worked my way up to become the production manager! Now I lead
                    a team of four people and I am reposible for all the documentation and work that goes on.
                </p>
