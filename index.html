<!--About Me-->
<div class="content-container" id="aboutme">
    <h2 class="content-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me-content">Hello, I'm Alex Frankhouser. I started coding in 2022 and fell in love. What I love about coding is that there's much to learn and improve upon.
                    Also, it's extremely satasfiying to watch the hardwork put into a project come together and make something amazing! I love putting my all into something and producing unique 
                    works of art.<br> When people describe me they tend to use the phrase "black & white person". I enjoy working with teams or by myself. No matter the situation I am faced with I will always stick it through!
                    
                    Previously in life I went to college to become a teacher and become a physical therapist assitant. I completed my Massachusetts Tests for Educator License (MTEL's).
                    After completing my MTEL's, I started my schooling to become a Physcial Therapist Assistant. Once I graduated I realized that working in the healthcare field was not for me so
                    I started my next venture by working full time at a wood yard. During this time I started from the bottom and worked my way up to become the production manager! Now I lead
                    a team of four people and I am reposible for all the documentation and work that goes on.
